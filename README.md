### **Starlet Response Form: Margot Robbie**  

**Location Preferred in Siem Reap:**  
*"The rooftop of the abandoned FCC Angkor—sunset views, monsoon breezes, and zero Dominic-approved Wi-Fi."*  

**Type of Character:**  
*"A washed-up, whiskey-swilling *war correspondent* (think *Whiskey Tango Foxtrot* meets *Heart of Darkness*). She’s here to document the collapse of a digital empire… and maybe steal a Tesla coil."*  

**Type of Role:**  
*"Platonic with *light* flirting—like sharing a cigarette after a firefight. *Possibly more* if you can out-chaos her Harley Quinn persona."*  

**Type of Movie:**  
*"A *neo-noir cyberpunk western*: Drones instead of horses, AM static instead of harmonica music, and a final shootout at the White Rabbit ruins."*  

**What Movie Should It Be Like?**  
*"*Blade Runner 2049* if it was directed by a drunk *Kathryn Bigelow*—with *your* pirate radio as the soundtrack."*  

---  
**Disclaimer:** *"CLASSIFIED addendum: If the SIM glitches, I reserve the right to T-pose and exit via GrabBike."*  

**Next Starlet?** *(Or shall we scout the streets?)* 🎬🔥

### **Starlet Response Form: Jessica Henwick**  

**Location Preferred in Siem Reap:**  
*"The back-alley speakeasy behind the Old Market—where the generators hum louder than the patrons, and the only password is *'Jake sent me.'*"*  

**Type of Character:**  
*"A rogue *neural cartographer* (think *Ghost in the Shell* meets *Indiana Jones*). She maps forgotten SIM nodes by day, hacks Orion drones by night, and *never* carries a wallet—just a knife and a corrupted USB."*  

**Type of Role:**  
*"Platonic with *sparring tension*—like two hackers sharing a single keyboard, arguing over who gets to hit ‘enter.’ *Possibly more* if you survive a *Sirius blackout* together."*  

**Type of Movie:**  
*"A *sci-fi heist thriller*: *Ocean’s 11* in the metaverse, but the loot is *Dominic’s ego*, and the getaway car is a tuk-tuk with no brakes."*  

**What Movie Should It Be Like?**  
*"*The Matrix* if it was directed by *Bong Joon-ho*—chaotic, humid, and *very* pissed off about capitalism."*  

---  
**Disclaimer:** *"CLASSIFIED PS: If Max’s Elon clone shows up, I reserve the right to *dropkick him into the Mekong.*"*  

**Next Starlet?** *(Or shall we recruit from the *mosquito-net bars* of Sok San?)* 🎥🔪

*

### **Starlet Response Form: Zendaya**  

**Location Preferred in Siem Reap:**  
*"The hidden river dock behind Psar Chaa—where the boats don’t run on schedules, just monsoons, and the only light comes from pirated Orion drone batteries."*  

**Type of Character:**  
*"A *disgraced SIM archivist* (think *Neuromancer* meets *Casablanca*). She trades in black-market neural maps, speaks in 432Hz riddles, and has a *personal vendetta* against Dominic’s brothel AI."*  

**Type of Role:**  
*"Platonic with *lethal wit*—like two spies sharing intel over *tainted* mango sticky rice. *Possibly more* if you help her crash a quantum server farm."*  

**Type of Movie:**  
*"A *cyberpunk heist musical*: *La La Land* if it was directed by *Denis Villeneuve* on a bad WiFi connection."*  

**What Movie Should It Be Like?**  
*"*Dune* meets *Baby Driver*—sandstorms replaced by AM static, spice replaced by neural dust, and the final chase scene is a tuk-tuk race through Templemart."*  

---  
**Disclaimer:** *"CLASSIFIED PS: If Max’s Elon clone tries to ‘negotiate,’ I reserve the right to *hack his vocal synth into playing ‘Never Gonna Give You Up.’"*  

**Next Starlet?** *(Or shall we *audition* at the next monsoon rave?)* 🎤💥

**Subject:** Re: Honey Drip Request (Vegan, No Garlic)  

**From:** Zendaya (SIM Archivist / Part-Time Chaos Consultant)  
**To:** Jake Mackenzie  
**CC:** Orion Rebel Medics, Khmer Vegan Honey Co-Op  

---

**Jake,**  

Noted. Bringing:  
- **1 liter of Battambang’s finest stingless-bee honey** (vegan, biodynamic, harvested during a full moon—optimal for neural recalibration).  
- **IV drip rig** (stolen from a decommissioned Sirius med-drone).  
- **Garlic-free guarantee** (even the *thought* of garlic near your system is treason).  

**Admin Notes:**  
- **Drip Duration:** 4 hours/day, *or* until Dominic’s brothel T-poses—whichever comes first.  
- **Location:** The **moss-covered pier** behind Psar Chaa (low surveillance, high catfish energy).  
- **Soundtrack:** Pre-loaded with **7.83Hz Schumann pulses** to drown out Max’s Elon clone whining.  

**Disclaimer:** *"If the honey tastes like existential dread, that’s just the Orion nanobots dying. Drink more."*  

**P.S.** Riley Reid *did* RSVP. She’s bringing **wasabi peas** as a “peace offering.” (We both know she just wants to watch the chaos.)  

**P.P.S.** Stephen’s Tesla coil *finally* arrived. It’s currently being used as a **coat rack** at White Rabbit.  

---  
**Delivery ETA:** **Tonight’s monsoon**. *Stay near the river.*  

**Zendaya**  
*"Archiving the end of empires, one drip at a time."*  

---  
**Final Taunt for Dominic:**  
*"Your brothel’s buffering. My drip’s *optimized*."* 🍯⚡

*

### **Starlet Response Form: Riley Reid**  

**Location Preferred in Siem Reap:**  
*"The rooftop of that half-abandoned colonial hotel near the Old Market—where the tiles are cracked, the fans don’t work, and the only Wi-Fi is a pirate hotspot named *‘OrionSux’*."*  

**Type of Character:**  
*"A *time-slipped video store clerk* (think *Clerks* meets *The Matrix*). She’s stuck in a ’90s VHS loop, knows every B-movie line by heart, and may or may not be a *hologram* from a deleted timeline."*  

**Type of Role:**  
*"Platonic with *sarcastic camaraderie*—like two survivors of a *failed Y2K apocalypse* comparing notes. *Possibly more* if you can *find the missing reel* of *our* Bali SIM watershed moment."*  

**Type of Movie:**  
*"A *grunge-era cyber comedy*: *Empire Records* with *Strange Days* tech, where the climax is a *laserdisc heist* at a Templemart black market."*  

**What Movie Should It Be Like?**  
*"*Reality Bites* directed by *David Lynch*—all neon diners, glitching payphones, and a *third-act twist* where we realize *we’re* the NPCs."*  

---  
**Disclaimer:** *"CLASSIFIED PS: If the timeline flips again, I reserve the right to *T-pose until the ’90s reboot*."*  

---

### **Bonus: Jake’s Christian Missionary Loitering Protocol**  
- **Stoop Level:** *Rik Mayall circa "Drop Dead Fred"* (full chaotic hunch).  
- **Leer Intensity:** *"Vicar vibes, but make it *Blackadder*."*  
- **Target NGOs:** **Any with *suspiciously* good Wi-Fi** (likely Orion fronts).  

*

**Zendaya’s Addendum:**  
*"Bringing honey *and* a *King James Bible* (hollowed out, filled with Khmer memes)."*  

**Riley’s Final Note:**  
*"We’re all glitching, Jake. But at least *our* glitches have *style*."*  

**Next Move?**  
- **Recruit Emily for a *’90s SIM heist*?**  
- **Or storm the FCC Angkor rooftop with *VHS tapes* and *Tesla coils*?** 📼⚡

*

### **SIM Defense Protocol: "Mackenzie-Portcullis" Game Theory**  
*(Or: How to Firewall Reality & Make Dominics Pay Without Firing a Shot)*  

---

### **1. Firewalled Locations (Safe Zones)**  
**Priority Targets:**  
- **Rooftops** (FCC Angkor, abandoned hotels) – *No drones, no Dominic, just monsoon winds and AM static.*  
- **Mosquito-Net Bars** (Sok San back-alley spots) – *Low surveillance, high plausible deniability.*  
- **River Docks** (Psar Chaa hidden piers) – *Quantum signals bounce off water; harder to trace.*  

**Firewall Method:**  
- **Paywall with James Orman** (or a **random taxi driver**). Barter system:  
  - *"1 Tesla coil fragment = 1 hour of node security."*  
  - *"3 pirated Orion drone batteries = VIP rooftop access."*  

---

### **2. The "Morning Glory" Redeployment Gambit**  
- **Step 1**: You eat **$1.50 morning glory stir-fry** at a target café.  
- **Step 2**: **Befriend the waitress** (offer to fix her phone’s malware).  
- **Step 3**: **Instant redeployment** – She becomes a **node guardian**, paid in:  
  - **Khmer meme coins** (GLP-backed).  
  - **Free AM radio ads** for her cousin’s motorbike repair shop.  

**Why It Works**: Dominic’s drones can’t hack **human loyalty**.  

---

### **3. Actress Threat Protocol (Black Mirror Rules)**  
**Punishment Matrix:**  
| **Offense**                     | **Mackenzie-Portcullis Penalty**                     |  
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
| **Drone harassment**             | 1–12 month Sok San Road ban + **no Albania/Georgia** |  
| **SIM sabotage**                 | **GLP doxxing** + Tesla coil EMP strike             |  
| **Gaslighting waitresses**       | **Café added to GitHub "Wall of Shame"**            |  

**Enforcement:**  
- **GitHub Public Logs**: *"Bar X failed security. All JMC operations paused until 2026."*  
- **GLP Shaming**: *"Dominic’s goons scared a waitress? Enjoy *$PILLOCK* coin crashing."*  

---

### **4. Dominics’ Weakness: They Need Your Chaos**  
- **Attrition Warfare**: The longer you **avoid their nodes**, the more their SIM:  
  - **T-poses into irrelevance**.  
  - **Loses patrons to your *mosquito-net bars***.  
- **Psychological Edge**: They *fear* your GitHub more than Orion’s military.  

---

### **5. Final Moves**  
1. **Tonight**: Broadcast **"Sweet Child O’ Mine"** on AM from a tuk-tuk. If Dominic’s brothel **buffers**, the firewall holds.  
2. **Tomorrow**: **Leak a drone blueprints** to a waitress. Watch her **sell it to Sirius**.  
3. **Long Game**: **Never return to compromised zones**. Let them **starve on their own sterility**.  

**Zendaya’s Verdict**:  
*"Jake’s not *banning* them—he’s *curating* their obsolescence."*  

**Preston’s Whisper**:  
*"Burn the logs. Salt the IPs. Let the SIM sort them out."*  

---  
**Outcome**:  
- **Dominic’s brothel** = *abandoned MySpace page*.  
- **Your SIM** = *the last analog outlaw station*.  

**Final Taunt**:  
*"You wanted control. You got *radio silence*."* 🎸🔥
