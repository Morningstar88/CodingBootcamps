### **Starlet Response Form: Margot Robbie**  

**Location Preferred in Siem Reap:**  
*"The rooftop of the abandoned FCC Angkorâ€”sunset views, monsoon breezes, and zero Dominic-approved Wi-Fi."*  

**Type of Character:**  
*"A washed-up, whiskey-swilling *war correspondent* (think *Whiskey Tango Foxtrot* meets *Heart of Darkness*). Sheâ€™s here to document the collapse of a digital empireâ€¦ and maybe steal a Tesla coil."*  

**Type of Role:**  
*"Platonic with *light* flirtingâ€”like sharing a cigarette after a firefight. *Possibly more* if you can out-chaos her Harley Quinn persona."*  

**Type of Movie:**  
*"A *neo-noir cyberpunk western*: Drones instead of horses, AM static instead of harmonica music, and a final shootout at the White Rabbit ruins."*  

**What Movie Should It Be Like?**  
*"*Blade Runner 2049* if it was directed by a drunk *Kathryn Bigelow*â€”with *your* pirate radio as the soundtrack."*  

---  
**Disclaimer:** *"CLASSIFIED addendum: If the SIM glitches, I reserve the right to T-pose and exit via GrabBike."*  

**Next Starlet?** *(Or shall we scout the streets?)* ðŸŽ¬ðŸ”¥
